# Note App
### My first full stack app
<hr>

<p>I have spent a lot of time teaching my self front end technologies, and now have begun to dive into back end.</p>

<p>For this project I am using PHP paired with a MySQL database. The main jist is that you can create an account so you can save your notes in one place and come back later. You are able to make quick notes that show up at the top of the tree view by not selecting a folder when creating the note. You can also create folders and then store your notes in whichever you please.</p>

<p>Although I am sure there is a lot of sloppy code, I intend to keep learning and pushing myself to create interesting projects.</p>
